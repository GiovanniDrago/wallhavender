# Privacy Policy

**Wallhavend** is an Android app that automatically sets wallpapers from [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc). This policy explains what data the app uses and how.

## Data collected and stored

All data is stored **locally on your device only** and is never transmitted to any server operated by this app.

## Third-party services

The app communicates with **[Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc)** to fetch wallpaper images based on your configured search settings. If you provide an API key, it is sent in the `X-API-Key` request header to Wallhaven. Wallhaven's own privacy policy applies to those requests.

No other third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services are used.
